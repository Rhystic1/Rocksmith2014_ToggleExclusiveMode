# Rocksmith2014_ToggleExclusiveMode
A very simple tool that allows you to switch Exclusive Mode on or off in Rocksmith 2014 in order to enable streaming or return to optimal latency settings.

HOW TO USE:

1) Extract Release.7z anywhere you like.
2) Run the .exe file.
3) Press the START button.

The program supports custom folders: if it can't find the game in the default directory, it will prompt you to select the Rocksmith.ini file manually.
