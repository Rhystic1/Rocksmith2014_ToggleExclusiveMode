# Rocksmith2014_ToggleExclusiveMode
A very simple tool that allows you to switch Exclusive Mode on or off in Rocksmith 2014 in order to enable streaming or return to optimal latency settings.

HOW TO USE:

1) Extract Release.7z anywhere you like.
2) Run the .exe file.
3) Press the TOGGLE button.
4) Press the Launch game button (optional). The program will automatically quit once the game is started.

The program supports custom folders: if it can't find the game in the default directory, it will prompt you to select the Rocksmith.ini file manually. You can also change the path in case you moved your installation folder or you have multiple installations by pressing the Change path button.
