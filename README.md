# Rocksmith2014_ToggleExclusiveMode
A very simple tool that allows you to switch Exclusive Mode on or off in Rocksmith 2014 in order to enable streaming or return to optimal latency settings.

HOW TO USE:

1) Extract ExclusiveMode.7z anywhere you like.
2) Run the .exe file.

If you realised you made a mistake, you can revert the changes by just pressing R. Then, press any key to close the program.

NOTE: For now, the program will only work if you have installed Rocksmith in the default folder.
